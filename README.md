_This is a folked version of https://github.com/google/robotstxt-java. I made the internal classes public, so that the other projects can use `RobotsParser` and `RobotsMatcher` programmatically._

# Google Robots.txt Parser and Matcher Library in Java

This project aims to implement the robots.txt parser and matcher in Java. It is
based on the [C++ implementation](https://github.com/google/robotstxt).

## About the library

The Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP) is a standard that enables website owners
to control which URLs may be accessed by automated clients (i.e. crawlers)
through a simple text file with a specific syntax. It's one of the basic
building blocks of the internet as we know it and what allows search engines
to operate.

Because the REP was only a de-facto standard for the past 25 years, different
implementers implement parsing of robots.txt slightly differently, leading to
confusion. This project aims to fix that by releasing the parser that Google
uses.

The library is a Java port of 
[C++ parser and matcher](https://github.com/google/robotstxt) which is a
slightly modified production code used by Googlebot, Google's crawler. The
library is released open-source to help developers build tools that better
reflect Google's robots.txt parsing and matching.

For webmasters, we included a runnable class `RobotsParserApp` which is a small
application that allows testing a single URL and several user-agents against a
robots.txt.

## Development

### Prerequisites

You need Maven to build this project.
[Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.html) and
[install](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) it from the official website.

You can also install it like this if your Linux supports it:

```
$ sudo apt-get install maven
```

### Build it

#### Using Maven

Standard maven commands work here.

```
$ mvn install
```

Or if you want a build from scratch:

```
$ mvn clean install
```

#### Using Maven Assembly Plugin

Alternatively, you can compile the entire project into a single JAR using the
following command:

```
$ mvn clean compile assembly:single
```

You can find the result in `target` directory. 

### Run it

#### Using Maven

Following commands will run an application that parses given robots.txt file
and print a matching verdict: `ALLOWED` or `DISALLOWED` (exit codes are `0`
and `1` respectively). 

You should provide a target URL using `-u` (`--url`) flag. At least one agent
must be specified using `-a` (`--agent`) flag (verdict `DISALLOWED` is printed
iff none of the user-agents are allowed to crawl given URL).

When flag `-f` (`--file`) is omitted, robots.txt contents are expected to be
received via standard input:

```
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.google.search.robotstxt.RobotsParserApp -Dexec.args="--agent FooBot --url http://foo.com/bar"
```

If you want the application to read an existing robots.txt file, use flag `-f`
(`--file`):

```
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.google.search.robotstxt.RobotsParserApp -Dexec.args="--agent FooBot --url http://foo.com/bar --file path/to/robots.txt"
```

#### From JAR

If you have built the project into JAR, you can run it from there (reading
robots.txt from standard input):

```
$ java -jar target/robotstxt-java-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar --agent FooBot --url http://foo.com/bar
```

Or (reading from file):

```
$ java -jar target/robotstxt-java-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar --agent FooBot --url http://foo.com/bar --file path/to/robots.txt
```

## Notes

Parsing of robots.txt files themselves is done exactly as in the production
version of Googlebot, including how percent codes and unicode characters in
patterns are handled. The user must ensure however that the URI passed to the
`Matcher` methods, or to the `--url` parameter of the application, follows the
format specified by RFC3986, since this library will not perform full
normalization of those URI parameters. Only if the URI is in this format, the
matching will be done according to the REP specification.
